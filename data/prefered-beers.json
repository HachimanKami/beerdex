Fake Art, fake brands, fake breasts, and fake lager. We want to play our part in the ugly fallout from the Lager Dream. Say hello to Fake Lager – a zesty, floral 21st century faux masterpiece with added BrewDog bitterness.","imageURL":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/8.png"},{"degreeAlcool":7.2,"levelBitterness":59,"color":"WEISS","id":5,"name":"Avery Brown Dredge","hasLiked":false,"description":"An Imperial Pilsner in collaboration with beer writers. Tradition. Homage. Revolution. We wanted to showcase the awesome backbone of the Czech brewing tradition, the noble Saaz hop, and also tip our hats to the modern beers that rock our world, and the people who make them.","imageURL":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/5.png"},{"degreeAlcool":5.3,"levelBitterness":60,"color":"IMPERIAL_STOUT","id":12,"name":"Arcade Nation","hasLiked":false,"description":"Running the knife-edge between an India Pale Ale and a Stout, this particular style is one we truly love.
